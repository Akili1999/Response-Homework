<p id="paragraph-1">My name is Akili James Kenneth McMackin, I'm 19 years old. I was born on October 20th, 1999, in Richmond Virginia. 
During my childhood, I explored a lot of my passions and found that I very much enjoyed music, and video games. In 2011, I moved to Apopka Florida, and attended middle school.
During my attendance at middle school, I would further grow my love for music, and eventually devoting more time to my guitar playing, which would become my main instrument.
In high school, I would end up attending virtual school.</p> 
<p id="paragraph-2">Virtual school was quite different from any other form of learning that I had been subject to at the time, it was an interesting experience.
By the end of high school, I would graduate from Lake County Virtual School, as magna cumlaude. Soon after graduation, I was seeking for a way to support my music finacially, and for a skill that I could learn for a stable job.</p> 
<p id="paragraph-3">That is where I found out about the UCF coding boot camp, and after researching the art of coding, I would become very interested in the subject. I enrolled, and about a year later, I would find myself in this course.</p>
